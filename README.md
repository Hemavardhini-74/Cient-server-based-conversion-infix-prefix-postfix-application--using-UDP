# Client-server-based-conversion-infix-prefix-postfix-application--using-UDP
This mini project details the socket programming. â€¢ This project includes the how the client and server works explained by the client server model.In this project using UDP for conversions, for sure, the development of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is revolutionary. It allows fast delivery, which is highly valuable for a number of applications.The main purpose of the UDP protocol enables computer applications to send messages, referred to as datagrams, to other systems on an IP (Internet Protocol) network.The solution and implementation for this project is based on UDP client server model. That we were able to execute the conversions of postfix, prefix, infix. Used #UDP_Client #UDP_Server to build the project.
